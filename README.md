# Garbage Classification - Week 1 Project

This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify different types of garbage (e.g., paper, plastic, metal, glass, and organic).

## Improvements Done:
- Built a simple CNN model using TensorFlow.
- Added a softmax classifier for multi-class prediction.
- Prepared the project to accept image data (150x150 RGB).

## How to Run
```bash
python main.py
```

## Output
```
Model created for Garbage Classification
```
